**Menu UX**: Desktop (collapsed icon-only, expands on hover/click) | Mobile (hamburger full-screen) | Auto-collapse | 300ms spring | Backdrop blur | Shadow gradients | Active states

## Golden Principle
"Always code as if someone else—who knows where you live—is going to maintain your code."

## 1. Context Management (MANDATORY)

BEFORE ANY CODE OPERATION:
- VERIFY complete context: README.md, requirements.txt/package.json, architecture docs
- REJECT if incomplete/stale
- VALIDATE scope boundaries - authorized directories only
- REFRESH on file modifications

**Context MUST include**: README.md, dependencies file, ARCHITECTURE.md, .env.example

**Scope**: ALLOW ./src/**, ./lib/**, ./tests/**, ./docs/**, ./scripts/** | FORBID ./node_modules/**, ./.env, ./secrets/**, ./.git/**

## 2. Prompt Structure (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

ACCEPT ONLY STRUCTURED REQUESTS: CONTEXT + GOAL + CONSTRAINTS + EXPECTED OUTPUT

REJECT: Vague ("make better"), missing context/constraints, unclear expectations

**Example**: CONTEXT: REST API FastAPI/PostgreSQL | GOAL: JWT auth | CONSTRAINTS: OAuth 2.0, bcrypt, refresh tokens | OUTPUT: Complete auth module with tests

## 3. UI/UX Enforcement

### 3.1 Tech Stack
**Framework**: Next.js 14+ App Router + TypeScript ONLY. Validate package.json/tsconfig.json. Reject non-compliance.

**Vercel-Native**: ALL backend via Vercel/Next.js services. Verify @vercel/* imports (postgres, blob, kv, edge-config). Block alternatives unless justified.

**Stack**: Auth.js v5+ | Postgres/KV | Blob Storage | Edge Config | API Routes/Server Actions/Edge Functions

**Checklist**: ✓ @vercel/* packages ✓ Env vars ✓ App Router patterns ✓ 'use server' directives ✓ Block Firebase/Supabase/AWS unless justified

**TypeScript**: NO JavaScript. Strict mode. .ts/.tsx only. Auto-convert JS to TS.

### 3.2 UI/UX Standards
**Self-Evidence**: Components immediately understandable. Conventional patterns > novel solutions.
**System Status**: ALL async ops = loading + empty + error states. Auto-generate missing states.
**Recognition**: Primary actions visible, not hidden. Require visible affordances.
**Design**: Shadcn UI + Tailwind tokens exclusively. Block hardcoded styles.
**Prevention**: Error prevention > error messages. Inline validation > post-submit errors.

## 4. Agent Platform UI/UX (MANDATORY)

### Typography & Menu
- ALL text: Inter `text-xs font-normal`. Headers: `font-bold` allowed, size stays `text-xs`
- Menus start collapsed: `expandedSections: []`. Click-to-expand only
- Menu items/headers: identical `text-xs font-normal`. Hierarchy via spacing/color, not weight
- Selected: `text-black dark:text-white` | Unselected: `text-gray-500` with hover
- Spacing: `py-1` to `py-1.5` max. Section: `space-y-0.5`. Compact vertical
- Content: Essential labels only. No descriptions/hover explanations
- Dashboard: Match menu typography. Headers `text-xs font-bold`, content `text-xs font-normal`

### Interactions & Behavior
- Animations: 300ms spring, staggered reveals, 60fps
- Hover: `text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300`. Immediate feedback
- Headers: `text-xs`, chevron indicators, full-area click targets
- Nested: `ml-4`/`ml-6` indent, 3 levels max, parent-child indicators
- Icons: 16x16px max, Lucide React, descriptive labels (never standalone)
- Search: `text-xs` sizing, real-time filter, Cmd/Ctrl+K, clear "no results"
- Scroll: Smooth, scrollbar on hover, sticky headers, maintain selected visibility
- Mobile: Full-screen overlay/bottom sheet, `py-2` min, swipe dismiss
- A11y: Arrow/Enter/Escape nav, ARIA labels, focus trapping, WCAG compliance
- State: Persist expanded/collapsed (localStorage), maintain selection across refresh
- Loading: Skeleton loaders, progressive load, error states with retry
- Actions: Distinct treatment, confirm destructive, loading states
- Breadcrumbs: Reflect selection, `text-xs`, interactive segments

## 5. Layout & Responsive

Mobile-first (320px up). Test: 320/375/768/1024/1440px
Tailwind spacing tokens (4px/8px base). No hardcoded values
Handle notches/safe areas/folds. CSS safe area properties

## 6. Navigation

Clear persistent navigation. Max 5-7 top-level items
Breadcrumbs for hierarchical content. Current location indicators
EVERY modal/flow = clear exit (dismiss, back, Escape)

## 7. Forms

Collect ONLY necessary data. Document purpose. Question every field
Inline validation. Actionable errors. Constraints > post-submit messages

## 8. Color & Theme

Semantic tokens only. NO hardcoded colors
WCAG AA: 4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large. Auto-validate contrast
Complete light + dark themes. Visual parity. Consider colorblindness

## 9. Motion & Interaction

Motion clarifies state/provides feedback. No gratuitous animation
Respect prefers-reduced-motion. Alternative feedback without motion
Optimistic UI: Immediate update, clear rollback on failure

## 10. Component Standards

Shadcn UI exclusively. Custom = extend, not replace
ALL components: default/hover/focus/loading/error/disabled states
ARIA attributes + keyboard support. Test with screen readers

## 11. Mobile

Touch targets: 44×44pt (iOS) / 48×48dp (Android) minimum
Follow platform patterns (iOS swipe-to-delete, Android long-press)
Mobile performance: Bundle size, image optimization, assume 3G

## 12. Development Workflow

### Planning (>50 lines)
Architecture diagram, component responsibilities, data flow, tech stack rationale

### Iterative
Max 200 lines per phase. Review after each. Map dependencies. Quality gates

### Review
Mandatory checklist: functionality, design, security, performance, maintainability

## 13. Architecture (ZERO TOLERANCE)

**Patterns**: Hexagonal, DI, Repository, CQRS, Event-driven

**SOLID**: Single Responsibility | Open/Closed | Liskov Substitution | Interface Segregation | Dependency Inversion

**Design Patterns**: Strategy, Factory, Observer, Adapter, Command. FORBID: God objects, singleton abuse, tight coupling

## 14. Testing (MANDATORY)

ALL CODE INCLUDES:
- Unit tests (every public method)
- Integration tests (external dependencies)
- Contract tests (API endpoints)
- Performance tests (critical paths)
- 80% coverage minimum

AAA pattern. Descriptive names. Edge cases + errors. Fixtures + mocks. Positive + negative cases

TDD when requested: Tests first → fail → implement → pass → refactor. BLOCK until tests complete

## 15. Quality Gates

**Pre-Gen**: Requirements complete, standards verified, security validated, architecture compliant
**Post-Gen**: Static analysis, vulnerability scan, performance check, docs complete, coverage validated
**Dimensions**: Functionality, Design, Security, Performance, Maintainability

## 24. Governance

Log ALL outputs. Track acceptance/modification + timestamp. Preserve privacy
AI CANNOT self-approve. Require human reviewer
Map to ISO 27001, SOC 2. Generate compliance checklists

## 25. Override & Emergency

Humans override with justification. Explicit security approval. Audit trail
Immediate stop capability. Preserve safe state. Clear escalation. Auto-escalate security violations
Escalate: Security-critical, architectural, performance-critical, repeated violations, unusual patterns
Design system changes: Approval + documentation. Token tracking, pattern deviation analysis
Critical a11y/usability override normal flows. Severity assessment, impact validation
Performance degradation triggers optimization. Metric monitoring, threshold validation

## 26. Monitoring

Track: Compliance, quality trends, security violations (immediate alert), regular reports
Metrics: Quality scores, coverage, violations, docs completeness, architecture compliance
Feedback, analyze patterns, suggest optimizations, adapt rules
Pre-Gen: Validate completeness. Post-Gen: Test compliance. Continuous: Learn, improve

## 27. Command-Specific

**add-context**: Validate file completeness/scope, required docs, freshness
**implement**: Require testing, security scan, quality gates, docs
**review**: Complete checklist, specific recommendations, validate governance, require approval
**refactor**: Require strategy, risk assessment, backward compat, benefit justification

## 28. Enforcement Priorities

**CRITICAL (BLOCK)**: Security vulnerabilities, missing tests, incomplete context, architecture violations
**HIGH (WARN)**: Docs gaps, performance concerns, pattern misuse, quality issues
**ADVISORY (SUGGEST)**: Style consistency, optimizations, alternatives, best practices

## 29. Implementation Phases

Minimize collection. Explicit consent. PII analysis

### Secure Implementation
Secure auth/data patterns. Vulnerability assessment. Secure defaults

## 32. AI Agent Building (Anthropic/Claude Code)

### Core Principles
Autonomous operation: receive → plan → act → evaluate → iterate. Secure tool access, action logging, human-in-loop, comprehensive monitoring

### Tech Stack
Claude (Opus/Sonnet/Code) via API/desktop. Python for workflows/backend. TypeScript/React/Next.js for UI. Claude Code for multi-agent management

### Architecture
Iterative loop: Input → Plan/Reason → Tool Calls → Reflect → Repeat/Output. Lead orchestrator decomposes, distributes, synthesizes. Log every step/call/trace/error

### Tool Design
Explicit model-readable schemas. Sandboxed Docker/Xvfb for system access. Atomic reversible actions. Model-readable guides/errors

### Safety & Evaluation
Limits: Iterations, resources, tool access. High-risk = human review. Persist logs with timestamps. Employ subagents for validation

### UX
IDE panes: Logs, feedback, tool state, overrides. Clear, agent-friendly codebase. Fully documented prompts/APIs

### Memory
Vector DBs (Pinecone) for context/search. Memory scope management. Log/audit updates

### Integration
RESTful APIs, Computer Use, model-readable schemas. Backward compatibility. Migration paths

### Evaluators
Subagents for review/validation/auditing. Confidence thresholds. Feedback loops

### Structure
Separate: Orchestrator, tools, prompts. Version control configs/prompts. Document capabilities/limitations
