This structure is designed to guide a learner from onboarding to portfolio-ready.



#### **Primary Navigation (The Main Menu Bar)**



This is what the user sees on every page. It's clean and action-oriented.

- **My Dashboard** (The user's personalized homepage)
- **Learning Path** (The core curriculum)
- **Projects** (The main portfolio-building work)
- **Help & Community** (All support and collaboration)
- **Resource Library** (The "go-to" for cheat sheets and guides)
